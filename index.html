            <p>Hello everyone, I'm 28 years old, I'm from Brazil, Sao Paulo. Currently I live in Provo, Utah.

                I Served a mission in Chile Rancagua between 2013 and 2015 and I'm married. I love playing basketball and soccer, going on hikes and snowbmobiling.
                
                I work with construction remodeling basements, and I also Do Day trading. I chose to pursue programming and learn computer science because I think everyone should learn how to program.
                
                I'm glad to be able to study online and to have time to work as well.</p>
